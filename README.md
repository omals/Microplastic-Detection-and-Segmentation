# Microplastic-Detection-and-Segmentation
Deep Learning-Based Microplastic Detection and Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model developed for detecting and segmenting microplastic particles from microscopy images. The work is based on the research project presented at NCMPE 2024, Cochin University of Science and Technology.

🔍 Overview

Microplastics pose a growing environmental threat, and manual identification through microscopy is time-consuming and error-prone.
This project explores U-Net–based segmentation to automate the detection of microplastics using deep learning.

🧠 Method

Preprocessing of microscopy images

Data augmentation for improved generalization

U-Net architecture for binary segmentation

Training with Dice Loss / BCE

Evaluation using IoU and Dice Score
